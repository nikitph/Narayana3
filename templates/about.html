            We are just one of you, fellow sufferers.
            Dysfunctional thought record plays such an important role in handling anxiety and depression. But didnt find any good online tools for it
            so we decided to make one and decided to put machine learning/crowd sourcing and data mining in the mix. Hope it helps all of you in your fight with anxiety and depression <br>
